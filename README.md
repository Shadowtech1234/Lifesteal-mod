hi, this is a addon for my friend to get on his xbox. This file is here so people can download it without having to download it from a website with weird and sus ads. Credit to the person who created it.


How to download:
PC:
To download the file, you have to click on the file that says .mcaddon at the end. Once clicking this, you must click download raw file. Once you do that, you will have the file.

XBOX:
Get the app file downloader on the store and download it. Once you do that, click "Download" then click "From URL", then put in the url: https://github.com/Shadowtech1234/Lifesteal-mod-test/blob/main/Life-Steal-hearts1.mcaddon       , after this, click on download raw file.


How to upload it:

   For pc  (mac does not work):
   once you have the file on your pc, you must have minecraft bedrock edition becuase this is a bedrock edition mod. If you have it installed, you can simply double click the file in your file manager.
      
  For Xbox  (Must be xbox one or xbox series s or x):
    To do this, there are 2 ways to do so:
    
  Paid (For this you must have at least 3 dollars on your xbox account):
    If you have 3 dollars to spare, you go to the store and buy and download "My Files Explorer". Once you have this, find the file you just downloaded using File Downloader. It should be at "Downloads" or "My Expansions" and select it and copy the file. Once you copied it, go to the file on the left that says "Packages", and then look for the file that says "Microsoft.Minecraft"(It should have some other stuff after that but I am too lazy to type it all out). Go into that file, go into "LocalState", then go to "games", then go into "com.mojang", then finally go into "behavior_packs". Once you are in that file, paste the file you copied. And then restart minecraft.

  Free way for xbox:
  For this, you need a PC of some kind. Then, open file downloader on your xbox, then click server on the left. Then follow the steps and activate it. Then you need to get your pc and go into "My PC", right click and then click "add network location". Then type what the file downloader has on the screen, this could be "ftp://192.246.5.67"(That is an example of what it might say, yours might say something else). Click "Ok" on your PC. Then double click that. Then once you have this, find the file you just downloaded using File Downloader. It should be at "Downloads" or "My Expansions" and select it and copy the file. Once you copied it, go to the file on the left that says "Packages", and then look for the file that says "Microsoft.Minecraft"(It should have some other stuff after that but I am too lazy to type it all out). Go into that file, go into "LocalState", then go to "games", then go into "com.mojang", then finally go into "behavior_packs". Once you are in that file, paste the file you copied. And then go back to your xbox, and click stop on the file downloader, then close it out and restart minecraft.

How to use it:
To use it, go into minecraft and click "play", then "new world", then go down into the setting and find behavior packs, click on activate the lifesteal addon and create the world. Them invite your friends and have some fun!
